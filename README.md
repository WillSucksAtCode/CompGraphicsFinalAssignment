*Farhan* - When it came down to part 2 (Texturing) I utilized two softwares to create custom models and textures to be implemented into the game. I used Blender to create custom 3D models and also UV unwrapped in blender as well using blender to smart UV unwrap for me. After creating the model and UV unwrapping, The model was exported as an FBX file and then brought into a different software, Substance 3D Painter. In Substance Painter, i added the textures/materials to the model and then exported the textures as specific 2D images for each slot in Unity: Albedo, Metallic, Normal Map, Height, and Occlusion.

As you can see in the image above, there's images in each slot that were specifically created thanks to Substance Painter and the image below is how the model and the textures look

First and foremost, Will and I couldn't get LUT to work in the game because we are using URP and LUT just doesn't want to co-operate. Although we couldn't get it to work we still tried our best by using the script and shader that was provided to us in the lecture. I used the basic Warm and Cool LUT that I created in photoshop which I then saved as a png and added it to the LUT shader material. 

*William* - For Part 4: Visual Effects, I added decals to our scene to create a more ominous feel to the scene by adding a bloody hand to our facility door. Decals are done by layering an extra texture on top of an already existing one. We do this by getting two textures and then applying the decal texture in the surf function using the albedo. In Unityâ€™s render pipeline, we implement it using a decal material on a decal projector. The image below is how it looks like.

*Farhan* - I used Unity's built in particle system to create the rain particles that is in our scene as well as particles for the guns to act as a muzzle flash. The rain particles are looped and are relased in a square shape around the player. I then chose "Random between two constants" in the linear section of velocity of its lifetime. The constants' values were only changed in the Y-Axis to -25, and -35. This way we can have different variations to how it falls. For the gun particles, I used the standard cone emission and were slightly modified for each gun to fit their firing styles.
